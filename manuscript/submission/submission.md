# Submission to Genetics Journal
- [Preparation](https://www.genetics.org/content/prep-manuscript)
- GENETICS accepts manuscripts in any format, including figures, tables, and references (e.g. it may be formatted according to another journalâ€™s guidelines or a format of your preference). For the review process, please include line numbers and page numbers if possible. You may also upload your manuscript as a PDF file. If your manuscript is accepted for publication, we'll ask you then to format the files for publication according to the guidelines below and provide the non-pdf files.

Thus, first you send the PDF, and then when accepted, you change format to publication (see [tex template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-preparing-your-submission-to-genetics-using-overleaf/stmpddtqcxtx))

-  Article Summary (< 100 words)
Standard methods for case-control association studies of rare and common variation often treat disease outcome as a dichotomous phenotype. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cases with a family history of disease can be enriched for risk variation relative to sporadic cases. Assuming family-history information is available, we replace the standard dichotomous outcome variable in case-control studies with a more informative outcome variable that distinguishes cases and controls with and without family history. We show that leveraging family-history information can greatly improve power in rare-variant association tests compared to standard dichotomous modeling of disease phenotypes that ignore such information.

# Abstract
Standard methods for case-control association studies of rare variation often treat disease outcome as a dichotomous phenotype. However, both theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that subjects with a family history of disease can be enriched for risk variation relative to subjects without such history. Assuming family history information is available, this observation motivates the idea of replacing the standard dichotomous outcome variable used in case-control studies with a more informative ordinal outcome variable that distinguishes controls (0), sporadic cases (1), and cases with a family history (2), with the expectation that we should observe increasing number of risk variants with increasing category of the ordinal variable. To leverage this expectation, we propose a novel rare-variant association test that incorporates family history information based on our previous GAMuT framework (Broadaway et al., 2016) for rare-variant association testing of multivariate phenotypes. We use simulated data to show that, when family history information is available, our new method outperforms standard rare-variant association methods like burden and SKAT tests that ignore family history. We further illustrate our method using a rare-variant study of cleft lip and palate.
